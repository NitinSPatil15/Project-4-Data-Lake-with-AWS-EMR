# Data Lake

### Introducion
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.  
We will build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables.  

#### Project Datasets
You'll be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:
> Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data  
> Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data  

Log data json path: s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json

#### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.  
> song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
> song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.  
    {"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}  

#### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.  
The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.  
> log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json  
> log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json  

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

#### Schema for Song Play Analysis
Using the song and log datasets, you'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.  
##### Fact Table
1.**songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page **NextSong** 
- start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent  

##### Dimension Tables
2.**users** - users in the app
- user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level

3.**songs** - songs in music database  
- song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration  

4.**artists** - artists in music database  
-  artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude  

5.**time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units  
- start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday  


#### Project Template
In addition to the data files, the project workspace includes six files:

> 1.**etl.py** reads data from S3, processes that data using Spark, and writes them back to S3.  
> 2.**dl.cfg** contains your AWS credentials.  
> 3.**README.md** provides discussion on your process and decisions.  


#### Project Steps
> 1.Implement the logic in **etl.py** to load raw data from given S3 buckets to create new tables using spark.  
> 2.Implement the logic in **etl.py** to load new tables to in parquet format on S3.  
> 3.Create the AWS EMR cluster with spark as processing engine and hdfs as storage in AWS. 
> 4.Copy the **etl.py** file on hdfs and run it using spark-submit command. Please remove the **config** related code as it is not required to run this file on EMR, else it will give errors.  
> 5.Check the output S3 bucket for output.  
> 6.Delete your Amazon EMR when finished.  

The song play data model is as follows
